There is no big difference as my implement is the same implementation But I will try with What I understood

 is not the best choice considering worst case, as  a student.
- By using the implementation of ArrayList
    In worst-case we must traverse the whole array each time we want to put, get or delete

- Implement a hashMap would be better choice in this case,
    as we will store the student in a key, value pair(s)
    we don't need to traverse the whole array each time we want to put, get or delete
    the operation will be performed in constant time O(1)

-  a binary tree would be better than the HashMap in this case,
    because we don't know the length of the students
    in worst case during the array copy the HashMap performance O(n)
    And the binary Tree Search performance is O(log n)

- My implementation would perform better than the other implementations
    because we accessing the targeted Tree via index in the array in constant time then search it
    without traversing the big Tree with all the students in it

- The method getByName's performance are worse than other operations defined in MyMap interface
    The defined method in the interface MyMap have time complexity O(log n)
    The method getByName that search in the whole array and traverse each tree at each index
    gives us O(n log n)
